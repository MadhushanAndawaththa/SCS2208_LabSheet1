    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello there! My name is Thiwanka Madhushan, and I'm currently a second-year undergraduate student at UCSC. Let me tell you a little bit about myself.</p>

    <p>I was born and raised in Meegoda, a small town in Sri Lanka. Growing up, I developed a keen interest in reading comics and manhwa. I spent hours immersed in the fascinating worlds created by talented authors and artists.</p>

    <p>I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree at the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC). It has been an exciting journey so far, and I'm continually expanding my knowledge in computer science and related fields.</p>

    <p>Aside from my academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for comics and manhwa. Exploring different genres and art styles brings me immense joy and inspiration. In my free time, you'll often find me engrossed in the latest releases and discussing them with fellow enthusiasts.</p>

    <div class="signature">
      <p>Best regards,</p>
